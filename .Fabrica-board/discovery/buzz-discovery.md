## 1. What Buzz Is

A **self-hostable team workspace where humans and AI agents are first-class equals**, built on the Nostr protocol. Tagline: "A workspace where humans and agents build together, on a relay you own." The core bet: "The relay is the workspace" — one community = one domain = one event log replacing chat + forge + CI dashboard + bots + search + glue code.

Key facts:
- Every action (message, reaction, workflow step, review approval, git event) is a **cryptographically signed Nostr event** (NIP-01 wire format, secp256k1/Schnorr). Agents and humans sign with the same kind of key — agents are members with their own keypairs, not bots.
- The **relay is the single source of truth**: auth, signature verification, persistence, fan-out, search indexing, automation triggering. No P2P, no gossip.
- A **community** is the tenant: the URL/host is authoritative for the workspace. Multi-community deployments scope every row/cache/document by host-derived community; unknown hosts fail closed.
- New feature = new event `kind` integer = zero breaking changes for existing clients.
- Ecosystem: Rust monorepo backend (relay), Tauri 2 desktop app, Flutter mobile app, browser repo-browser web client served by the relay, agent CLI/harness surface, git hosting on the same domain.
- Naming history: previously "Sprout" (legacy traces: sprig harness, sprout-cli skill, ~/.sprout → ~/.buzz migration in desktop).

## 2. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Rust workspace (~30 crates), Axum WebSocket server (`buzz-relay`) |
| Protocol | Nostr NIP-01 over WebSocket + narrow HTTP bridge; NIP-42/NIP-98 Schnorr auth |
| Storage | Postgres 17 (events w/ monthly partitioning, FTS via generated tsvector + GIN), Redis 7 (pub/sub, presence SET EX, typing ZADD), S3/MinIO (Blossom media) |
| Desktop | Tauri 2 + React 19 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS 4 + TanStack Query/Router + Radix + TipTap + Biome |
| Mobile | Flutter (Riverpod + flutter_hooks, no StatefulWidget allowed), Catppuccin theme |
| Web | React 19 + TanStack Router/Query + isomorphic-git (in-browser git) |
| Agents | ACP (Agent Client Protocol, JSON-RPC over stdio) harness; MCP tools; supports goose/codex/Claude Code |
| Git | Smart HTTP hosting on relay; nostr-signed commits/tags (NIP-GS); NIP-98 credential helper |
| Infra | Docker Compose (dev + prod bundle w/ Caddy TLS), Helm charts (+ push-gateway chart), Prometheus metrics |
| Toolchain | Hermit-pinned: Rust 1.88+, Node 24, pnpm 10/11, Flutter 3.41, Just, lefthook, biome, cargo-deny |
| Formal methods | TLA+ specs (MultiTenantRelay, GitOnObjectStore) + Tamarin (MultiTenantAuth) with mutation-testing harnesses |

Quality gates: `just ci` (fmt+clippy+tests+builds), pre-commit auto-fix hooks, pre-push differential file-size gate (1000 lines/file hard ceiling across desktop/web/mobile), DCO sign-off required, no `unsafe`, no new unwrap/expect in production paths.

## 4. Vision Documents (product direction)

| Doc | Core idea |
|---|---|
| VISION.md | Flagship: relay-as-workspace. One domain hosts repos (`git clone repoa.myproject.com`), chat, agents. Seven surfaces: Home feed, Stream (real-time chat), Forum (async threads), DMs (≤9), Agents directory/job board, Workflows, Cmd+K Search — three lenses over one event log. Zero-notification defaults. Scale target: 10K humans + 50K agents (~600K events/day). Server-managed encryption (eDiscovery-friendly). Voice huddles with agent peers. Mesh GPU compute. Greenfield build via AI agent swarms w/ crossfire review. |
| VISION_SOVEREIGN.md | "Your Project, Your Domain": content negotiation serves HTML to browsers AND git protocol at the same URL — the repo IS the website. Identity = npub everywhere; portable reputation via signed contribution history; web-of-trust vouches (incl. for agents). Honest costs listed (key loss = identity loss, nostr onboarding friction). |
| VISION_PROJECTS.md | Nostr-native forge: NIP-34 repo announcements extended w/ `buzz-` tags (channel binding, visibility, branch protections enforced at git transport layer); branches are channels (patches kind:1617, CI results, reviews, merge decisions live together; merge archives the channel as permanent record); NIP-OA owner attestation gives agents maintainer access instantly; NIP-MP groups cross-owner repos into projects without granting authority. Issues = forum-rendered events; releases = agent-drafted changelogs approved by maintainers. |
| VISION_AGENT.md | buzz-agent + buzz-dev-mcp philosophy: small enough to hold in your head, ten-instances-parallel, auditable in an afternoon. Two binaries, two protocols (ACP stdio + MCP), no coupling. Minimal/hardened/protocol-native/honest ("the agent is just a loop that stops when it cannot proceed"). Up to 8 concurrent sessions per agent process, each with own MCP servers/history/context; self-summarizes history when context fills. |
| VISION_MESH.md | Community GPU pooling: opted-in member GPUs become shared OpenAI-compatible inference behind the membership gate (same gate as channel access). Peer-to-peer request routing; relay never sees tokens. Large models split across machines. Explicit consent framing. |
| VISION_ACTIVITY.md | Agent Activity Feed design: every item answers Comprehension/Confidence/Control. Each item = one sentence (verb, object, outcome). Twelve render classes (spine: message/relay-op/file-edit/shell/turn-lifecycle; context: thought/plan/permission/error; ambient: generic/raw/suppressed). Outcome-first, mutate-in-place, never go dark, honesty over guessing. |
| VISION_MODERATION.md | Moderation as human workflow: private report queue → owner/admin decision → signed enforcement commands (ban/timeout) biting at authentication. No shadow bans; tombstones with sanitized reasons; tamper-evident audit rows. Platform safety (illegal content) never delegated to communities. Reports never stored in public event log. |
| VISION_REMOTE_AGENTS.md | Same agent, new body: identity/history live on relay so compute is replaceable. One-way launch handoff through swappable provider binary (Kubernetes first); afterwards ALL control flows over the relay (mention it to steer, tell it to stop). Agents self-reap via inactivity timers. Provider conformance suite pins the contract. |

## 5. Protocol & Event Model

### Wire protocol (NIP-01)
Client→relay: `["EVENT", e]`, `["REQ", sub_id, filter…]`, `["CLOSE", sub_id]`, `["AUTH", e]`.
Relay→client: `["EVENT", sub_id, e]`, `["EOSE"]`, `["OK", id, bool, msg]`, `["CLOSED"]`, `["NOTICE"]`, `["AUTH", challenge]`.
Limits: max frame 65,536 B; 1024 subscriptions/connection; 500 historical results/filter; handler semaphore 1024 concurrent EVENT/REQ.

### Kind ranges
0–9999 standard Nostr · 10000–19999 replaceable · 20000–29999 ephemeral (not stored/audited/searched) · 30000–39999 parameterized replaceable · 40000–49999 Buzz custom.

## 6. Relay Backend (crates)

### Connection lifecycle (buzz-relay)
Step 0 community binding (host→TenantContext before any handler; unknown host fails closed) → Step 1 connection semaphore acquire → Step 2 NIP-42 challenge sent immediately → Step 3 auth (Pending→Authenticated(AuthContext)/Failed) → Step 4 three loops (recv inline, send spawned via mpsc, heartbeat ping/30s w/ 3-miss disconnect) + CancellationToken shutdown + slow-client grace (3 consecutive full send buffers → cancel) → Step 5 cleanup (cancel, await tasks, remove subscriptions, deregister, drop permit).

### Event pipeline (per EVENT message, ordered)
1 AUTH check (MessagesWrite scope) → 2 pubkey match → 3 KIND_AUTH reject → 4 ephemeral route (20000–29999 bypass DB/audit/search) → 5 verify_event (spawn_blocking; Schnorr + SHA-256 ID) → 6 channel membership check → 7 DB insert (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING) → 8 Redis publish (if channel-scoped) → 9 fan-out (three-tier registry; global subs excluded from private-channel events — security boundary) → 10 search index (bounded queue cap 1000) → 11 audit log (spawned) → 12 workflow trigger (spawned; excludes kinds 46001–46012, relay-signed `buzz:workflow` messages, gift wraps). Steps 10–12 fire-and-forget; OK frame after full pipeline.

### SubscriptionRegistry
DashMap-backed three-tier fan-out: tier 1 `(channel_id, kind)` index O(1); tier 2 channel wildcard (no kinds constraint); tier 3 global linear scan (non-channel-scoped events only). `kinds: []` matches nothing; absent kinds = match all. REQ handler checks channel access BEFORE registering subscription (no race window for private-channel leaks). Historical query up to 500/filter then EOSE.

### HTTP surface (Axum)
GET `/` (WS upgrade or NIP-11 info), `/info`, `/.well-known/nostr.json` (NIP-05), `/health`, `/_liveness`, `/_readiness`; POST `/events` (same ingest path as WS), `/query` (NIP-01 filters; NIP-50 search routed to FTS), `/count` (NIP-45), `/hooks/{id}` (workflow webhook, secret-authenticated constant-time compare); PUT `/media/upload` (Blossom, 50 MB), GET `/media/{sha256}`; GET `/git/{owner}/{repo}/info/refs`, POST `/git/.../git-upload-pack` + `/git-receive-pack` (smart HTTP); POST `/internal/git/policy`.

### buzz-core (zero I/O)
StoredEvent, filters_match (OR across filters, AND within; NIP-01 prefix matching on IDs), verify_event (CPU-bound), is_private_ip (comprehensive SSRF blocklist IPv4+IPv6+mapped), ALL_KINDS registry, pairing module (NIP-AB spec doc embedded).

### buzz-auth
NIP-42 verify_auth_event (±60s timestamp tolerance; grants all 14 scopes), NIP-98 validate_nip98_auth (kind:27235 w/ URL+method tags). AuthContext {pubkey, scopes, method}. Scopes: MessagesRead/Write, ChannelsRead/Write, AdminChannels, UsersRead/Write, AdminUsers, JobsRead/Write, SubscriptionsRead/Write, FilesRead/Write. RateLimiter trait exists but NO production implementation (known limitation #2); RateLimitConfig defines 4 tiers (human, agent-standard, agent-elevated, agent-platform) as design target. Dev-only key derivation SHA-256("buzz-test-key:{username}") feature-gated.

### buzz-db (Postgres, sqlx runtime queries)
Modules: event.rs (insert ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING returning was_inserted; query_events via QueryBuilder), channel.rs (CRUD, transactional TOCTOU-safe role enforcement; types Stream/Forum/Dm/Workflow; roles Owner/Admin/Member/Guest/Bot; soft-delete members via removed_at), feed.rs (query_mentions INNER JOIN normalized event_mentions table; query_needs_action; query_activity; FEED_MAX_LIMIT=100), workflow.rs (workflow/run/approval CRUD; approval tokens stored SHA-256-hashed, single-use via `AND status='pending'`), partition.rs (monthly range partitioning events + delivery_log; DDL injection protection via allowlist), dm.rs, reaction.rs, thread.rs (reply_count/descendant_count materialized counters), user.rs. Run statuses: Pending/Running/WaitingApproval/Completed/Failed/Cancelled.

### buzz-pubsub (Redis)
Dedicated PubSub connection (pool connections can't PSUBSCRIBE); PUBLISH buzz:channel:{uuid} → PSUBSCRIBE loop → broadcast::channel(4096) → consumer fans out locally; multi-node wired w/ local-echo dedup (moka cache of locally-published IDs). Reconnect backoff 1s→30s doubling. Presence: SET EX 180 (3× heartbeat). Typing: ZADD window 5s, EXPIRE 60s. Multi-community keys prefixed buzz:{community}:….

### buzz-search (Postgres FTS)
search_tsv generated tsvector column populated on insert (to_tsvector('simple', content)), GIN-indexed; privacy-sensitive kinds (1059 gift wrap, 30300 reminders, 30622 DM visibility) yield NULL tsv = storage-level unsearchable. ChannelScope enum (Any/ChannelLessOnly/Channels/ChannelsOrChannelLess). Every query carries community_id (BitmapAnd with btree filters). Returns candidates only — relay re-authorizes each hit.

### buzz-audit
SHA-256 hash-chain append-only log; hash covers seq/timestamp/event_id/kind/actor/action/channel/metadata(BTreeMap canonical)/prev_hash; genesis = 64 zeros; pg_advisory_lock single-writer (panic-safe catch_unwind); verify_chain() walks. 10 actions (EventCreated…RateLimitExceeded). Refuses KIND_AUTH and ephemeral events. Per-community chains in multi-community mode.

### buzz-workflow (YAML-as-code engine)
Definition: name, trigger{on: message_posted|reaction_added|schedule|webhook, filter evalexpr}, steps[] {id, action, if, params}. 7 actions: send_message, send_dm (stubbed NotImplemented), set_channel_topic (stubbed), add_reaction, call_webhook (SSRF-guarded, redirects disabled, 1 MiB cap), request_approval (Suspended w/ UUID token — not yet persisted/resumed end-to-end 🚧WF-08), delay (max 300s). Templates {{trigger.text}}/{{trigger.author}}/{{steps.ID.output.FIELD}} single-pass. evalexpr conditions w/ str_* helpers, dot→underscore conversion, 100ms eval timeout. Concurrency Arc<Semaphore> 100 permits, try_acquire → CapacityExceeded (no queuing). Cron scheduler ticks 60s. Run statuses incl. WaitingApproval.

### Huddle audio (inside buzz-relay src/audio/)
WS endpoint /huddle/{channel}/audio; NIP-42 auth + membership check per participant; in-memory rooms; forwards opaque Opus frames; frame protocol v2 (8-byte BE header: seq u16, 48kHz timestamp u32, level dBov i8, flags u8 — invalid levels clamped not dropped); soft cap 25 peers (hard 255 u8 index); bounded per-peer channels (drop-on-full audio, never-drop control); lifecycle Nostr events (joined/left/ended; last peer leaves → room ends + channel archives atomically). Recording/tracks reserved but unbuilt.

### Other backend crates
- buzz-media: Blossom/S3 blob storage (upload/download, sha256-addressed).
- buzz-push-gateway: blind capability-gated NIP-PL push gateway for mobile (leases, match queue/gate per migrations).
- buzz-relay-mesh: inter-relay QUIC mesh transport + membership + fenced wire contract.
- buzz-deletion: durable whole-community deletion engine.
- buzz-conformance: runtime trace schema + replay checker for the MultiTenantRelay TLA+ spec.
- buzz-voice: reusable local voice primitives (Opus/NetEQ/STT/TTS used by desktop huddles).
- buzz-datastore-tracing: tracing utilities.

### Security model (relay)
Every event Schnorr-verified pre-storage; ID hash verified independently; frame-size cap; hex validation before URL construction; alphanumeric-only workflow step IDs (evalexpr injection guard); partition-name allowlist (DDL injection); SSRF blocklist on outbound webhooks; webhook secrets compared constant-time; approval tokens CSPRNG UUID stored hashed single-use; membership = the only access gate, checked pre-subscription; TOCTOU-safe transactional membership ops; AUTH events never stored/audited.

### Known limitations (documented, verified)
No sqlx compile-time query cache · no rate-limit implementation (trait only) · no typing REST endpoint · huddle recording/tracks unbuilt · approval gates not wired end-to-end (runs hit gates → marked Failed) · send_dm/set_channel_topic workflow actions stubbed.

## 7. Agent Surface (the heart of Buzz's agent story)

### buzz-acp (ACP harness, 14 files/40,631 lines)
```
Buzz Relay ──WS──→ buzz-acp ──stdio (ACP/JSON-RPC)──→ Agent (goose/codex/claude-code)
                                   └─ agent replies via buzz-cli
```
- Listens for @mentions on the relay; queues events per channel; at most ONE prompt in-flight per channel; queued mentions batched into a single session/prompt.
- Pool of 1–32 agent subprocesses with claim/return lifecycle; crash detection + respawn.
- Config (CliArgs): relay_url, private_key, agent_owner (NIP-OA), agent_command+args, mcp_command, idle_timeout, max_turn_duration, turn_timeout, system_prompt(+file), agents count, heartbeat_interval + heartbeat_prompt, turn_liveness_secs, initial_message, subscribe mode + kinds + channels filters, no_mention_filter, dedup mode, multiple_event_handling, no_ignore_self, context_message_limit, max_turns_per_session, presence/typing toggles, memory toggles, base_prompt_file, model, effort_level, session_title, permission_mode, respond_to + allowlists, team_instructions, relay_observer, exit_after_inactivity, lazy_pool, idle_pool_sleep.
- Modules: relay.rs (3,143 ln WS+REST+NIP-42), queue.rs (2,565 per-channel batching/dedup), main.rs (2,457 event loop/pool orchestration/heartbeat), pool.rs (2,253 claim/return), config.rs (1,903), acp.rs (1,785 stdio JSON-RPC/timeouts), filter.rs (814 evalexpr subscription rules).
- Auth env vars injected into managed agent subprocesses: BUZZ_RELAY_URL, BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY, BUZZ_AUTH_TAG.
- Discovers channels via GET /api/channels?member=true; auto-subscribes on membership notifications.

### buzz-cli (agent-first CLI, 29 files/17,772 lines)
JSON in / JSON out, designed for LLM tool calls. Reads return sig-stripped JSON arrays; writes return {event_id, accepted, message}. Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 input, 2 network/relay, 3 auth, 4 other, 5 write conflict (NIP-33 LWW). Global flags: --format compact|json, scoping. Deep links: `buzz://message?channel=<uuid>&id=<hex>` → `messages thread --channel --event`.

Command groups & subcommands (from lib.rs enums):
- **agents** (1,169 ln): draft-create, draft-update, archive, unarchive, archived (+ agent management module).
- **messages** (1,265 ln): send, send-diff, edit, delete, get, thread, search, vote.
- **channels** (1,602 ln): list, get, search, create, update, topic, purpose, join, leave, archive, unarchive, delete, members, add-member, remove-member, set-add-policy.

Plus client.rs (2,299 ln REST/WS wiring), validate.rs (438), links.rs, agent_management.rs (257).

### buzz-agent (minimal ACP agent, 21 files/27,579 lines)
"Stdio in, tool calls out. Non-streaming. No persistence. No cleverness." Loop: LLM call → tool calls → run via MCP → feed results → repeat; terminates when LLM stops, round cap hit, or client cancels. Output IS its tool calls; text forwarded as agent_message_chunk. Providers: Anthropic Messages API, OpenRouter, any OpenAI-compatible (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, Databricks OAuth PKCE, Block Gateway) via BUZZ_AGENT_PROVIDER env. Up to 8 concurrent sessions each with own MCP servers/history/context; self-summarizes history on context overflow. Files: llm.rs (7,488), config.rs (2,119), agent.rs (1,514), auth.rs (1,214), lib.rs (998), types.rs (1,052), mcp.rs (1,126), catalog.rs (659), handoff.rs (595), hints.rs (649), builtin.rs (529), wire.rs (499), model_capabilities.rs (840).

### buzz-dev-mcp (developer MCP server, 11 files/5,202 lines)
Tools: **shell** (bash; Windows resolves Git Bash or BUZZ_SHELL; ephemeral processes, process-group kill on every exit path, bounded output), **read_file**, **view_image** (1,076 ln), **str_replace** (file editing), **todo** (task tracking, 512 ln), plus internal _Stop/_PostCompact hooks; rg.rs (ripgrep integration, 453 ln), tree.rs, paths.rs, shim.rs.

### buzz-persona (persona packs, 9 files/4,612 lines)
`.persona.md` format = YAML frontmatter (name, display_name, description; caps 1 MiB frontmatter/256 KiB body) + markdown body = system prompt. Modules: manifest, merge, pack, resolve, validate. Example pack: examples/meadow-core (personas bana/lev/skip + github-research skill + instructions.md).

### sprig (all-in-one harness, 50 lines)
Single binary bundling buzz-acp + buzz-agent + buzz-dev-mcp (own Dockerfile; CI workflows sprig.yml/sprig-image.yml).

### Git integration
- **git-sign-nostr** (NIP-GS): signs commits/tags with BIP-340 Schnorr; plugs in as gpg.x509.program; keys from NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY > BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY > git config nostr.keyfile (hex or nsec); optional NIP-OA owner attestation via BUZZ_AUTH_TAG.
- **git-credential-nostr** (NIP-98): credential helper; on 401 + WWW-Authenticate: Nostr, builds signed kind:27235 event over URL+method, base64 → Authorization: Nostr <token>. git 2.46+ required; CI-friendly via env var.

### Pairing
- **buzz-pair-relay**: ephemeral sidecar relay for NIP-AB device pairing handshakes.

## 8. buzz-admin (operator CLI)
add-member (--pubkey npub/hex, --role; publishes kind:13534 roster) · remove-member · list-members · generate-key · reconcile-channels (emits kind:39000/39002 discovery events idempotently). Shipped inside relay Docker image at /usr/local/bin/buzz-admin.

---

## 9. Desktop App (Tauri 2 + React 19, 2,672 files)

Stack: React 19, TanStack Query v5 + Router v1 (file-based routes), Radix UI, TipTap composer, dnd-kit, emoji-mart, motion, sonner, jdenticon, qrcode, zod v4, mediapipe tasks-vision. All signing/crypto in Rust (nostr-tools is devDep only). Zoom = root font-size scaling; rem-only text enforced by CI guard (check:px-text); virtual typography rem token system; HSL CSS-variable theming w/ sidebar palette + git status colors.

### 29 feature modules (src/features/)
agents (largest: creation/edit events, managed-agent runtime reconciliation, active-turn store per community, working signal, card minting, observer relay ingestion kind 24200, prevent-sleep, snapshot import/export, owner-only gating) · agent-memory (engrams UI) · channel-templates (apply/create/duplicate) · channels (unread tracking, read-state sync NIP-78 kind 30078 d-tagged docs, live updates, welcome-agent channel) · chat (header) · communities (multi-community storage/navigation; useCommunityInit.resetCommunityState() tears down ALL community-scoped singletons; React key remount boundary) · community-members · custom-emoji · forum (45001/45003) · home (unified inbox/feed) · huddle (voice state machine, PTT mic controls, add-agent dialog, transcription, companion windows; ~40 Rust commands) · identity-archive · local-archive (SQLite event archive, sync manager) · mesh-compute (share-compute toggle; mesh_start/stop/status/model_catalog behind mesh-llm feature) · messages (typing broadcast/receive, paginated history, threads + panel, missing-ancestor loading, drafts, optimistic sends, background media uploads, link previews) · moderation (reports 1984 + mod commands 9040–9044) · notifications (feed-driven + macOS native UNUserNotificationCenter) · onboarding (machine/community/welcome-kickoff/invite/key-backup flows) · presence (kind 20001) · profile (kind 0, avatar upload, NIP-05) · projects (git: repos/branches/commits/diffs/PRs/issues/work items; ~25 project_git* commands) · pulse (activity feed) · reminders (40007/30300) · search (NIP-50 scoped) · settings (updater, ncryptsec encrypted backups, feedback) · sidebar (channels, DM metadata, relay connection card) · terminal (embedded PTY via portable-pty: attach/detach/input/resize/scroll/focus) · user-status (30315) · workflows (runs, approvals grant/deny, triggers).

### Tauri backend (~250 invoke commands)
Groups: terminal (9), deep links (buzz:// scheme; pending queues for community/entity/navigation; single-instance forwarding), builderlab hosted communities (login/create/archive/transfer), identity & keys (get/import/sign_out, ncryptsec backup create/verify/save, sign_event, create_auth_event, NIP-44 encrypt/decrypt, observer frames), profile/users, projects/git (snapshot/diff/clone/branch/push/pull/merge PR/signed issues), relay (URLs, membership CRUD, admission probe, reconnect hook), channels/messages (full CRUD, reactions, forum, canvas, feed, search, history-before, channel window), media (upload/download/transcode/gif/snapshot, clipboard, media proxy port), agents (ACP discovery/install/connect, managed agents CRUD/start/stop/restart/reconcile, logs, model discovery OpenRouter/Databricks/env, personas CRUD/shared, teams CRUD, snapshots export/import, card minting, backend providers probe), workflows, social (notes timeline/reactions), huddle (~45: start/join/leave/end, PCM audio push, STT pipeline sherpa-onnx, TTS voices, agent voice routing, PTT shortcut, model downloads), pairing (start/confirm SAS/cancel), workspace (apply_workspace, repos dir validation, join policy), archive (save-subscriptions, backfill, usage series), misc (OS idle, prevent sleep, vibrancy, link previews incl. YouTube, updater support).

Boot sequence: sentinel wipe → migrations → identity resolution (fatal if lost) → recovery gates → persona backfill → harness registry warm → mesh coordinator → media proxy spawn → nest ensure (~/.buzz dirs) → CLI symlink → orphaned-agent sweep (60s loop) → persona-event flush (30s loop).

Secrets: OS keyring (system-keyring feature) falling back to 0o600 files; ncryptsec encrypted backups. Plugins: deep-link, opener, single-instance, window-state, dialog, updater (release builds only), process, global-shortcut, notification. Bundles external binaries: buzz-acp, buzz-agent, buzz-backend-kubernetes, buzz-dev-mcp, git-credential-nostr, buzz CLI.

### Shared frontend infra
RelayClient singleton (~970 ln) over NATIVE Rust WebSocket (Tauri Channels) — resilience stack: reconnect controller/policy/replay prioritizing visible channel, rate-limit gate w/ parsed hints, stall watchdog, closed-connection policy, first-event-gated history, query-invalidation bridging relay events into React Query, read-only + observer clients. kinds.ts mirrors kind.rs (plus curated kind sets for unread/timeline/aux fetches). Typed Tauri wrappers per domain (~20 modules). Feature-flag store over preview-features.json. E2E mock bridge (fake __TAURI_INTERNALS__ compiled only with --mode e2e).

Testing: node test runner unit tests colocated; Playwright smoke (~170 spec files) + relay-backed integration + perf configs (typing latency, scroll smoothness); helpers w/ real Nostr test identities, seed builders, mandatory waitForAnimations, dual-relay harness, fake ACP agent fixture.

## 10. Mobile App (Flutter, 547 files)
Riverpod + flutter_hooks (StatefulWidget banned). Catppuccin Latte/Macchiato matching desktop. Features under lib/features/: channels (largest — list/detail/thread/compose/emoji picker/message actions/media viewer/unread badges/typing/mentions/deep links + agent_activity submodule w/ transcript builder), forum, home, activity/inbox, pulse (social notes feed), search, profile, invites, pairing (QR scanner + crypto + SAS), settings (theme/accent/community/connection). Shared: relay/ (WebSocket-first connectivity; HTTP only for Blossom media upload; nostr_models.dart kept in sync with desktop kinds.ts; rate-limit gate; signed-event relay; mp4 fast-start), auth, crypto, deeplink (buzz://), emoji/custom_emoji, mentions, read_state, reminders, security (biometric lock via local_auth; secure keypair storage), theme, widgets. Badges via app_badge_plus; rich rendering gpt_markdown + highlight.

## 11. Web Clients
- **web/** (buzz-web): React 19 + TanStack Router/Query + isomorphic-git in-browser. Routes: /, /repos, /repos/$repoId (+blob viewer w/ syntax highlighting), /invite/$code. Repo browsing: tree, README, refs, commits, clone URLs, "Connect on Buzz". Served statically BY THE RELAY (BUZZ_WEB_DIR / BUZZ_SERVE_GIT_WEB_GUI=true) — same-origin WS derivation. Custom CI guards: file sizes, pubkey truncation.
- **admin-web/** (buzz-admin-web): operator dashboard — moderation report queue (grouped reports, detail, act/dismiss, 403 handling) + product feedback browsing (migration 0017). Tiny: api.ts/types.ts/useResource.ts/App.tsx (836 ln custom routing).

## 12. Infrastructure & Ops
- Dev: docker-compose.yml (Postgres 17, Redis 7, Adminer, MinIO, Prometheus) w/ health checks + resource limits; just setup/dev/relay/build/check/test-unit/test/ci/reset.
- Prod: deploy/compose (single-node VPS bundle + Caddy TLS via !reset override + run.sh bootstrap w/ secret generation) and deploy/charts/buzz (full Helm: Deployment/Ingress+HTTPRoute/HPA/PDB/PVC git data/ServiceMonitor/pairing-relay sidecar/bundled MinIO init/ArgoCD+Flux examples/values.schema.json + render tests) and charts/buzz-push-gateway.
- Migrations: 31 SQL files auto-applied on startup (BUZZ_AUTO_MIGRATE). Arc: base schema → git → moderation → push gateway evolution → community archival/deletion/recovery → product feedback → mesh status → join policies → TTL fencing/locking → invites → replica heartbeat → indexes → workflow error codes.
- Release lanes (RELEASING.md): desktop (candidate PR → squash merge = human authorization → auto-tag verifies provenance → immutable desktop-v tag → multi-platform builds → updater manifest last), relay (docker.yml → ghcr.io stable + debug- + :main/:sha tags), mobile (RC tags cut by GitHub App bot; Buildkite internal builds). Canary workflows per OS. 18 GitHub workflow files total.
- Benchmarks: harbor-buzz-orchestra (Python uv package) orchestrating multi-agent runs against a Buzz testbed compose stack w/ manifests, personas, relay forwarder, leaderboard. perf/: relay bus scaling measurements.
- Formal methods: TLA+ MultiTenantRelay + GitOnObjectStore, Tamarin MultiTenantAuth, mutation-testing harnesses, buzz-conformance replay checker.

## 13. Architectural Patterns Worth Carrying Into Fabrica's Transformation

Directly relevant to "desktop CLI agent management and operations platform":
1. **Agents as first-class members with their own cryptographic identities** — same affordances as humans, same audit trail, different keypair. Scoped by identity, not permission flags.
2. **One signed event log as universal substrate** — chat, patches, approvals, workflow steps, git events all one shape → unified search, unified audit.
3. **Kind-integer extensibility** — features are new event kinds; old clients never break.
4. **Agent harness pattern** (buzz-acp): @mention → per-channel queue → batched prompt → ACP subprocess pool (1–32) w/ crash respawn, heartbeats, turn timeouts, liveness checks, respond-to allowlists, effort levels.
5. **Agent-first CLI** (buzz-cli): JSON in/out, sig-stripped compact output, meaningful exit codes, deep-link resolution — built for LLM tool-call consumption.
6. **Minimal agent runtime** (buzz-agent): LLM-loop + MCP tools, multi-session, history self-summarization, provider-swappable via env.
7. **Managed agents** (desktop): spawn/start/stop/restart/reconcile lifecycle, nest directories, persona/team projections as relay events, orphan sweeps, turn metrics (kind 44200), observer frames (kind 24200).
8. **Remote agents**: identity/history on relay, body replaceable, one-way launch handoff, control exclusively via relay messages, self-reaping inactivity timers, provider conformance contract.
9. **Persona packs** (.persona.md YAML frontmatter + markdown system prompt) and teams as first-class shareable artifacts.
10. **Agent memory (engrams)** as addressable events (kind 30174) with CLI mem subcommands (ls/get/hash/set/patch/rm).
11. **Activity feed UX theory** (VISION_ACTIVITY): sentence-per-item, outcome-first, mutate-in-place, twelve render classes, deliberate suppression.
12. **Approval gates** on workflows (request_approval suspension + grant/deny events 46010–46012/46030/46031).
13. **Branches-as-channels**: git lifecycle mapped onto rooms; merge archives the room as permanent record.
14. **Multi-tenant isolation done formally** (host-derived TenantContext before any handler; TLA+/Tamarin verification; conformance replay checker).
15. **Tamper-evident audit** (hash chain) and honest tombstones for deletions/moderation.
16. **Community-scoped everything** including caches, pub/sub keys, search documents, audit chains.

## ROUND 2 DEEP DIVE — buzz-relay internals (handlers, git hosting, tenancy, connections)

### R2.1 Layout (src/, ~79 files)
main.rs (2,136: config, pools, migrations, background tasks, graceful shutdown) · router.rs (561: all HTTP routes, CORS, body limits, SPA fallback) · state.rs (2,198: AppState, connection manager, community connection control) · config.rs (1,558 env-driven w/ validation) · connection.rs (1,025 WS lifecycle) · subscription.rs (1,764 (channel,kind) fan-out index) · admission.rs (138 rate-limit seam) · tenant.rs (304 row-zero host binding) · protocol.rs (424 NIP-01 parsing) · metrics/telemetry/nip11 · invite_token.rs (HMAC) / webhook_secret.rs · push_runtime.rs (665 durable NIP-PL matcher + gateway worker) · storage_sweep.rs (1,008 hourly S3 usage sweep) · workflow_sink.rs (648 relay-side ActionSink emitting kind:9) · mesh_boot.rs (700 inter-relay mesh) · conformance/ (TLA+ trace emission at ingest/read boundary). Dirs: handlers/ (18), api/ (bridge 3,523; media 1,257; invites 1,673; operator 1,160; workflows; nip05; admin/) + api/git/ (10 files), audio/ (huddle voice: handler 1,404, join 2,837, room 728), tunnel/ (mesh tunnel sessions: Redis fenced lease directory 923, reliable-stream routing 866).

### R2.2 Handlers (key logic)
- **event.rs** (2,301): verify → route ephemeral 20000–29999 (WS-only; presence special-case kind 20001), encrypted observer frames 24200, gift wraps, else ingest pipeline. Per-subscriber pre-encoded frame cache (serialize once for N subs); bounded Prometheus kind labels; viewer-private kinds (30622 DM visibility, 44200 agent turns) strip p-tags for non-recipients.
- **ingest.rs** (4,848): "two doors, one room" — WS EVENT and POST /events share ingest_event: signature verify (spawn_blocking) → timestamp freshness ±15 min → tenant/channel scoping → per-kind envelope validators (edits 40003 ownership, votes 45002 targets, diffs 40008, engrams 30174, personas 30175, team catalogs 30178, projects 30621, repo state 30618, turn metrics 44200, reminders 30300…) → scope authorization per kind → storage → command-kind routing. Reactions (kind 7) atomic dedup upsert pre-storage; deletions derive channel from target; create-group compensates (deletes channel) on later failure. TLA+ conformance traces at accept/reject.
- **req.rs** (2,171): MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS 1024/conn, FILTER_QUERY_CONCURRENCY 4, MAX_EXPLICIT_CHANNEL_VALUES 128 #h values; visibility gating (p-gated kinds 403 without kinds, author-only, result-gated, DM event_visible_to_reader); NIP-50 search → FTS.
- **auth.rs** (324): pure challenge verification; extracts NIP-OA agent auth tag for owner-delegation membership.
- **command_executor.rs** (1,486): transactional command kinds (41010–41012 DM ops, 30620 workflow defs, 46020 triggers, 46030–46031 approvals): validate → tx insert → mutations → commit; webhook secret generation (SHA-256).
- **side_effects.rs** (3,330): group discovery events 39000–39002, member notifications, NIP-43 lists, archival events, thread summaries; evicts kicked users' live subscriptions by pubkey-in-community walk.
- **relay_admin.rs** (817): NIP-43 kinds 9030–9033 processed directly, never stored; role changes owner-only.
- **moderation_commands.rs** (697): 9040–9044 community-global, fresh timestamp required, channel-scoped tokens rejected; ban = upsert + audit + live disconnect + notice DM.
- **moderation_authz.rs** (313): single capability seam; roles only from tenant-scoped tables; v1 grid (owner/admin all; channel owner/admin DeleteMessage/Kick in-channel).
- **moderation_notices.rs** (368): relay-signed notice DMs via moderation key; never names reporters or quotes report notes.
- **report.rs** (298): reports are "signals, never triggers"; e-targets resolved in-tenant only (never cross-tenant search); x-targets = (community_id, sha256).
- **identity_archive.rs** (702): consent paths SelfSigned/Owner/Admin; live kind:0 profile must attest requester; mutates archived_identities + emits relay-signed deltas before storing request.
- **push_lease.rs** (720): strict serde deny_unknown_fields envelope validation; push kinds [7, 9, 1059, 40007, 46010]; tenant from TenantContext never decrypted origin.
- Also: product_feedback (category enum, ≤32KB body, imeta verified vs media sidecar), imeta validation shared module, community_provisioning (operator allowlist above tenants).

### R2.3 Git hosting on object storage
Routes: GET info/refs (120s), POST git-upload-pack (300s, 64MB decoded gzip-bomb cap), POST git-receive-pack — all NIP-98 auth via GitAuth extractor; reads require active membership in the repo's bound channel (no public repos v1). **Repos are not on disk**: content-addressed create-only pack writes (SHA-256 keys, If-None-Match: *), single pointer object per repo swapped via ETag If-Match CAS (412 = semantic LostRace outcome), manifest validation (safe refnames/OIDs/pack keys), startup conformance probe (32-way race × 3 rounds) as fail-closed deployment gate; hydrate.rs materializes ephemeral bare repos into scratch for read/write with LRU pack cache. Push flow: no per-repo lock — writer serialization IS the pointer CAS (loser's work discarded, accepted v1 tradeoff); cas_publish (pack→idx→manifest→pointer CAS) completes before any 2xx. Policy hooks: injected bash pre-receive hook reads old/new/ref lines, FF-detects via merge-base against quarantine dirs, POSTs to loopback-only /internal/git/policy (HMAC-SHA256 over length-prefixed payload + 30s TTL, fail-closed); policy resolves kind:30617 protections, grants owner authority to repo key or verified managed-agent owner (NIP-OA), maps Bot→Member role, evaluates push perms per-ref.

### R2.4 Multi-tenancy (row-zero)
bind_community normalizes host (lowercase, strip trailing dot/default ports, keep IPv6 brackets) → HostResolver queries communities table UNIQUE(lower(host)); empty host fails closed BEFORE lookup with byte-identical UnmappedHost error (no probing). No default/fallback tenant. WS door binds before upgrade (no frames read unbound; generic 404 never echoes host). Every HTTP surface repeats row zero independently (bridge/media/invites/operator/workflows/nip05/git/audio). Server-internal paths use bind_deployment_community over the deployment's own relay_url authority (not a fallback). community_id enforced in: every DB query, membership checks ("admitting a pubkey to community A never admits it to B"), NIP-OA backfill, git pointer keys + BUZZ_COMMUNITY_ID in HMAC-bound hook callback, subscription SubEntry carries CommunityId, Redis topics namespaced, moderation roles tenant-scoped, deletion serving fences validated at boot (refuses unsafe start).

### R2.5 Connection management
Admission: check_principal over Redis-backed RateLimiter trait; Exceeded → rejection w/ retry hint; Redis down → fail-closed (separate metric reason=unavailable). WS budget = fixed-window 5s burst (per-sec × 5) so desktop startup bursts don't trip averages. Per-type limits from config: human_messages_per_min / human_api_calls_per_min / human_ws_events_per_sec; invite claims process-local 10/pubkey/60s bounded 10k pubkeys. Lifecycle: global conn semaphore try_acquire (no queuing) → row-zero binding → challenge → 5s AUTH_TIMEOUT cancels slot-holders → send_loop (batches ≤64 frames, control-frame priority) + heartbeat + recv loops; handler_semaphore caps concurrent handlers. Slow clients: try_send backpressure counter, grace_limit cancellations metricized, success resets. Frame limits set at parser level (default 512KB) + app-level defense in depth. Shutdown: readiness 503 + shutting_down; drain closes live conns w/ close code 1012 (Service Restart) after jittered delay (≤20s); exactly one 1012 flush guaranteed (unit-tested). Health router separate port no-auth: /_liveness, /_readiness (Postgres ping + Redis pool + deletion fences, 2s timeout), /_status, /_mesh. Audio: tighter caps (4KB Opus frames, 30s heartbeat, 25 peers/room), try_send everywhere (drops tolerated, never queued), cross-pod joins arbitrated by Redis fenced CAS leases validating {session_id, generation, owner_runtime_id}.
