# Verify — Fabrica-app Discovery (Task 2.3)

> Group 2 — Verify, Roadmap 02, Round 1. Verification Pass 1.
> Verifies `.Fabrica-board/discovery/fabrica-app-discovery.md` against `Fabrica-app/`.

## 1. File Count Reconciliation

| Measure | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Total files (excl. node_modules/.git) | 15,563 (incl. ~2,347 build output in out/) | ✅ counted |
| src/main | 3,414 across 81 domain folders | ✅ all 81 folders verified against disk |
| src/renderer/src/components | 55 feature dirs | ✅ all 55 verified against disk |
| src/shared / cli / relay / preload | 1,222 / 165 / 232 / 21 | ✅ covered |
| mobile / tests / config / skills+guides+stubs / native / Casks / workflows | 1,220 / 473 / 342 / 24 / 32 / 2 / 28 | ✅ covered |

## 2. Directory Completeness (programmatic check)

- `src/main/`: **81 directories on disk = 81 documented** — zero missing, zero phantom ✅
- `src/renderer/src/components/`: **55 directories on disk ⊆ documented** — zero missing ✅
- Top-level repo entries: all accounted for in discovery §3 ✅

## 3. Gap Check

| # | Gap found | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | None structural. Deep internals not read line-by-line: fabrica-runtime.ts (37,549 lines), individual handler bodies, individual React components | Accepted scope | Structure, responsibilities, and patterns captured; flagged as Round-2 deep-dive candidates |
| G2 | Rebrand residuals confirmed during scan: `mobile/README.md` "Orca Mobile", `@stablyai/playwright-test` dependency, opencode references in CLI examples | Info (known) | Already documented in discovery §13.10; matches Roadmap 01 tracking |
| G3 | `NUL` file at repo root (Windows artifact) | Trivial | ignore |

## 4. Accuracy Spot Checks

- Startup sequence, runtime/rpc/orchestration decomposition, daemon degradation path, provider contracts, hook-service pattern — cross-consistent across two independent deep-scan passes (main-process agent + cli/relay/mobile agent) ✅
- CLI command groups (19 spec groups) match handlers/ module list ✅
- Zustand slice inventory (~45) consistent between store/index.ts structure and documented table ✅
- package.json version/bins/scripts verified directly ✅

## 5. Verdict

**PASS with 0 patches required.** Every main-process subsystem folder and every renderer feature directory is accounted for. The scale of unread file bodies (runtime 37K lines etc.) is inherent to a 15K-file codebase and does not affect architectural completeness; Round 2 can go deeper on runtime/orchestration and rpc/methods if desired.

*Verification Pass 1 result: 0 open gaps.*

## Group 2 Summary (all three verifications)

| Repo | Files | Coverage | Gaps found | Patches applied | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mission-control | 492 (~180 source) | full | 7 minor | 5 | PASS |
| buzz | 4,121 | full | 4 minor | 2 | PASS |
| Fabrica-app | 15,563 | full (structural) | 3 trivial/info | 0 | PASS |

Group 2 complete → proceed to Group 3 (Synthesis & Concept Mapping).
